## Overview

This page summarizes **completed and ongoing research projects** led or
co-led by **Chengxue Li**, with a focus on **spatial stock assessment**,
**state-space modeling**, and **Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE)**.
These projects integrate methodological development, simulation
experiments, and applied fisheries management questions, often in close
collaboration with scientists at **NOAA Fisheries**, universities, and
international partners.

## Completed Projects

### SPASAM-MSE: A Generalized Spatial MSE Framework

**Li, C.\***, Deroba, J.J., Goethel, D.R., Berger, A.M., Schueller, A.M.,
Langseth, B.J., Hanselman, D.H., Liljestrand, E.M., and Miller, T.J.
(2025)  
**SPASAM-MSE: a generalized spatial management strategy evaluation
framework for exploring the impacts of spatial structure on stock
assessments and management outcomes**  
*Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences* (accepted with minor
revision)

This project introduces **SPASAM-MSE**, a flexible and extensible
framework for evaluating fisheries management strategies under
**spatially structured population dynamics**. Built on the **Woods Hole
Assessment Model (WHAM)**, SPASAM-MSE enables closed-loop simulation
experiments linking spatial operating models, data generation,
estimation models, projections, and harvest control rules.

Key contributions include:

- A generalized spatial MSE architecture supporting multiple stocks,
  regions, fleets, and movement processes  
- Explicit treatment of movement, connectivity, natal homing, and
  metapopulation structure  
- Systematic evaluation of spatial misspecification between operating
  and estimation models  
- Quantification of management risk and spatial trade-offs in catch,
  biomass, and fishing mortality

### Random Effects on Numbers-at-Age and Implicit Movement Dynamics

**Li, C.\***, Deroba, J.J., Berger, A.M., Langseth, B.J., Goethel, D.R.,
Schueller, A.M., and Miller, T.J. (2025)  
**Random effects on numbers-at-age transitions implicitly account for
movement dynamics and improve stock assessment and management**  
*Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences* (Just-IN)  
https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2025-0092

This study demonstrates that introducing **random effects on
numbers-at-age transitions** in state-space assessment models can
implicitly absorb movement dynamics, even when movement is not
explicitly modeled.

Key findings include:

- Numbers-at-age random effects can partially capture unmodeled spatial
  processes  
- Improved estimation performance and management advice under spatially
  structured operating models  
- Reduced bias and improved robustness relative to deterministic
  age-transition models

## Ongoing Projects

### Is Single-Region Management Adequate for Spatially Structured Stocks?

**Li, C.\***, Deroba, J.J., Berger, A.M., Goethel, D.R., Langseth, B.J., Schueller, A.M., Liljestrand, E.M., and Miller, T.J.

This project evaluates whether **single-region management frameworks**
are sufficient for managing **spatially structured populations**, with a
particular emphasis on **catch apportionment**.

Core questions include:

- When does spatial aggregation lead to biased or risky management
  advice?  
- How do alternative catch-apportionment schemes affect regional and
  stock-level outcomes?  
- Under what conditions is spatially explicit management necessary for
  sustainable and equitable outcomes?

### Forecasting Fisheries Management under Data-Limited Futures (US Northeast)

**Led by:** Jonathan Deroba (NOAA NEFSC)  

This project examines how fisheries management strategies perform under
future **data-limited conditions**, including reduced survey coverage
and declining data quality in the US Northeast.

---

### Wind Farm Mitigation in Spatial Stock Assessment

**Led by:** Chengxue Li (Stony Brook University)  

This project explores how offshore wind development may affect stock
assessment and management, and how **alternative survey designs** can
mitigate potential impacts.

---

### Handling Numbers-at-Age Random Effects in State-Space Projections

**Led by:** Emily Liljestrand (NOAA NEFSC)  

This work develops pragmatic strategies for projecting state-space
assessment models that include **numbers-at-age random effects**.

### Climate-Informed MSE for Georges Bank Yellowtail Flounder

**Led by:** Sophie Wulfing, Gavin Fay (UMass Dartmouth)

This project integrates climate-driven processes into a spatial MSE
framework for **Georges Bank Yellowtail Flounder**, examining how climate
signals interact with assessment and management decisions.

### Climate-Informed MSE for Black Sea Bass (Northeast US)

**Led by:** Jeewantha Bandara, John Wiedemann (Rutgers University)

This study applies climate-informed MSE approaches to **Black Sea Bass**
in the Northeast US, focusing on climate impacts on productivity,
distribution, and management performance.
